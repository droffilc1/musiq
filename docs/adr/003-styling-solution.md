# Styling with Tailwind CSS
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2024-11-18

## Context
The Spotify client requires a scalable styling solution that supports modern UI/UX and rapid prototyping. The options considered are Tailwind CSS, CSS modules, and styled-components.

## Decision
I will use Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Consequences
### Positive
- Utility-first approach speeds up development and ensures consistency.
- Built-in responsive design support.
- Minimal CSS file size due to purging unused classes.

### Negative
- Learning curve for the utility-first approach.
- Inline class names may reduce readability in JSX.

## Alternatives Considered
### CSS Modules
**Pros:**
- Scoped CSS to avoid global naming conflicts.

**Cons:**
- Slower prototyping compared to Tailwind.

### Styled-Components
**Pros:**
- Dynamic styling and theming support.

**Cons:**
- Runtime cost for styling can impact performance.
