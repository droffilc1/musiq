# Data Fetching Strategy
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2024-11-18

## Context
The Spotify client application will interact with the Spotify API to fetch and manage data such as playlists, tracks, and user information. A robust data fetching strategy is required to ensure:
1. Efficient data retrieval and caching.
2. Automatic updates when data changes on the server.
3. Simplified error handling and retries.

Traditional approaches, such as using `fetch` or `axios` within `useEffect`, introduce significant boilerplate and lack features like caching, query invalidation, and server-state synchronization.

## Decision
**React Query** will be used as the data fetching and server-state management library.

### Why React Query?
- **Automatic Caching:** React Query caches data and minimizes redundant network requests.
- **Simplified API Management:** Built-in hooks like `useQuery` and `useMutation` streamline data fetching and updates.
- **Automatic Refetching:** React Query handles refetching stale data and synchronizing it with the server.
- **Error Handling:** Provides robust error boundaries and retry mechanisms.
- **Flexibility:** Supports custom fetchers (e.g., using `axios`).

### Implementation
1. **Services Folder:**
   - API calls will be encapsulated in the `src/services/` directory to keep the logic separate from components.
   - Example file: `services/spotifyAPI.ts`.

2. **Custom Hooks:**
   - Custom hooks will be created in `src/hooks/` to wrap React Query's `useQuery` and `useMutation` for specific data-fetching needs.
   - Example file: `hooks/useSpotifyAPI.ts`.

3. **React Query Client:**
   - A centralized React Query client will be configured in the `App.tsx` to provide context for all React Query hooks.

## Consequences
### **Positive**
- **Performance:** Cached data reduces network requests and improves app responsiveness.
- **Developer Experience:** Reduces boilerplate code for fetching, caching, and error handling.
- **Scalability:** Easily handles complex query scenarios as the app grows.

### **Negative**
- **Learning Curve:** React Query introduces a new API that requires understanding its lifecycle (e.g., stale, fetching, and invalidation states).
- **Bundle Size:** Adds a small overhead to the application's bundle size.

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Axios with Context or Redux:**
   - **Pros:** Familiar to most developers.
   - **Cons:** Requires manual caching and synchronization logic, increasing code complexity.

2. **Apollo Client (GraphQL):**
   - **Pros:** Well-suited for GraphQL APIs.
   - **Cons:** Unnecessary overhead for a RESTful API like Spotify.

3. **Raw Fetch/Axios:**
   - **Pros:** Lightweight and easy to use for small-scale projects.
   - **Cons:** Lacks built-in features for caching, retries, or synchronization.

## Implementation Plan
1. **Set Up React Query:**
   - Install React Query and configure the Query Client in `App.tsx`.
   - Example:
     ```tsx
     import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from 'react-query';

     const queryClient = new QueryClient();

     function App() {
       return (
         <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
           <YourAppComponents />
         </QueryClientProvider>
       );
     }
     ```

2. **Create Spotify API Service:**
   - Encapsulate API logic in `services/spotifyAPI.ts`. Example:
     ```ts
     import axios from 'axios';

     const api = axios.create({
       baseURL: 'https://api.spotify.com/v1',
       headers: {
         Authorization: `Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN`,
       },
     });

     export const fetchUserPlaylists = async () => {
       const { data } = await api.get('/me/playlists');
       return data;
     };
     ```

3. **Build Custom Hooks:**
   - Use `useQuery` to fetch data, e.g., `hooks/useSpotifyAPI.ts`:
     ```ts
     import { useQuery } from 'react-query';
     import { fetchUserPlaylists } from '../services/spotifyAPI';

     export const useUserPlaylists = () => {
       return useQuery('userPlaylists', fetchUserPlaylists);
     };
     ```

---

## Status and Next Steps
The React Query setup will be implemented as described. Initial queries will focus on user data (e.g., playlists) and can be expanded for additional API endpoints as needed.
