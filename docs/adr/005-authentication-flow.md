# Implementing OAuth2 for Authentication
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2024-11-18

## Context
To access user data and playback features, Spotify requires apps to implement OAuth2 authentication. This involves exchanging an authorization code for an access token.

## Decision
I will implement OAuth2 for authentication using Spotify's API.

## Consequences
### Positive
- Secure, standardized authentication method.
- Allows access to user-specific Spotify data.

### Negative
- Adds complexity to the project with token management and refresh logic.

## Alternatives Considered
### Implicit Grant Flow
**Pros:**
- Simplifies token management by avoiding refresh tokens.

**Cons:**
- Less secure and discouraged for modern applications.
