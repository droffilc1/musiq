# Spotify Web API Integration
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2024-11-18

## Context
The Spotify client requires data such as user playlists, tracks, and playback control. Spotifyâ€™s Web API is the main option for integration, requiring proper authentication via OAuth2.

## Decision
I will use Spotify's Web API for data integration and playback control.

## Consequences
### Positive
- Comprehensive API with access to all required Spotify features.
- Widely supported in libraries like `spotify-web-api-node`.

### Negative
- Requires implementing OAuth2 authentication, which adds complexity.

## Alternatives Considered
### Mock API (for development only)
**Pros:**
- Simplifies development without API rate limits.

**Cons:**
- Not viable for production; lacks real Spotify data.
