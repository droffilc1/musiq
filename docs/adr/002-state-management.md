# State Management with Context API (Scalable to Redux Toolkit)
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2024-11-18

## Context
The Spotify client requires state management for global application states such as:
- User authentication details.
- Playback state (current track, play/pause).
- Spotify API data caching (e.g., playlists, user preferences).

The project currently has simple state management needs. The options considered are:
1. React Context API (with hooks).
2. Redux Toolkit.

## Decision
I will use the **React Context API** for initial state management due to its simplicity and native React support. If state management requirements become more complex (e.g., additional middleware, asynchronous actions, or large-scale state), I will migrate to **Redux Toolkit**.

## Consequences
### Positive
- **React Context API:**
  - No additional dependencies or libraries required.
  - Easy to set up and maintain for small-scale global states.
- **Redux Toolkit (scalable option):**
  - Provides a robust and scalable state management solution.
  - Built-in support for middleware (e.g., Thunk for async actions).
  - Excellent developer tools for debugging state.

### Negative
- **React Context API:**
  - Can lead to performance issues (e.g., unnecessary re-renders) if the state grows significantly or becomes too complex.
- **Redux Toolkit:**
  - More boilerplate and setup compared to React Context API.

## Alternatives Considered
### Zustand
**Pros:**
- Lightweight and minimal boilerplate.
- Good for simple or modular state management.

**Cons:**
- Lacks the community and tooling support of Redux Toolkit.

## Transition Plan (if needed)
1. Monitor the complexity and size of the application's global state.
2. If performance or scalability issues arise, migrate to Redux Toolkit:
   - Use the `createSlice` and `configureStore` APIs for a seamless setup.
   - Refactor Context state into Redux reducers.
